// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

ANSWER 1:  A = 1, b = 2, A + B , C = sum, print = (C)
// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ANSWER 2: if C (sum) is even then print in red or odd then print green

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are. ANSWER 3: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5 (defining variables), a+b+c+d+e=x (add the sum of all variables a thru e and get the sum variable called x), x = sum, x = 15, then x/5=3 (dividing the sum of all variables a thru e by the total number of variables), smallest number 1, largest number is 5 of the variables a thru e
